A collection of pure Python scripts exploring data analysis, data cleaning, and recommendation systems fundamentals.

# Data Analysis with Pure Python 🐍

This repository documents my **data science learning journey using pure Python**, without relying on libraries like NumPy, Pandas, or ML frameworks.

The goal of this project is to deeply understand:
- Data representation
- Data cleaning logic
- Relationship-based recommendations
- Algorithmic thinking using core Python

---

## 📂 Project Structure

### 1️⃣ Data Analysis
- Basic exploration of structured JSON data
- Understanding users, friendships, and page relationships

📁 `analysis/`

---

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Removed users with empty names
- Removed duplicate friends
- Removed users with no activity
- Deduplicated pages by ID

📁 `cleaning/`

---

### 3️⃣ Recommendations System
Implemented two recommendation algorithms from scratch:

#### 👥 People You May Know
- Based on **mutual friends**
- Uses graph-like traversal logic

#### 📄 Pages You Might Like
- Based on **shared page interests**
- Scores recommendations using overlap counts

📁 `recommendations/`

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (core only)
- JSON
- Google Colab
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
This project helped me strengthen:
- Problem decomposition
- Clean coding practices
- Data-driven logic
- Real-world recommendation system thinking
